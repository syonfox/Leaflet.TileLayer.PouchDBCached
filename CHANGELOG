# 1.0.1 (2021-11-19)
This is an excellent plugin I added support for a debug render layer.
on its way to becoming a slick ui There is also the failings of a parallel
network stream, but I think it's broken :(
anyhow there is now a
testSeed Function
 changelog:
 - added compatibility with Leaflet.ContinuousZoom.js
 - added errorTileUrl eviction so that previously failed tiles which had their error tile cached will be evicted when online
 - added error seed status and tests seed debugging layer.
 - improved seed event data (so you can hook into the seed drawing data and do it yourself if you wanted)
 - added useful tileToFeature()
 - added getStoredTilesAsGeojson() function
 - added showStoredTiles() function
 - some jank seedWorker code not working


# 1.0.0 (2019-02-06)

* Switched from base64-encoded images to PouchDB attachments (should perform
  much better)
